# Unsuperviesed multi-level fusion transformer for blind hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion (*Pending*)
This is an deep-learning based fusion algorithm that fuse hyperspectral and multispectral image in a unsupervised manner in coping with unknown degradation in spectral and spatial domain. The uMLFT fully exploits the long-range and multi-level information of the both MSI and HSI. For an HSI with size of 16x16x31, the proposed HSMS can achieve 32x spatial improvement with very high accuracy in 850 seconds. The quantitative results outperform exisiting SOTA algorithms.
